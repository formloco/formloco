# formloco

formloco is zero to low-code project for the creation, sharing and analysis of data.

Data is represented by forms. Forms can collect and display data. Forms consist of controls, connectors and IoT widgets.

Controls, connectors and IoT widgets are put on the form canvas using the drag-n-drop studio. Textboxes, multi-selects, file upload, GPS are some of the controls that are included with the project. Things like analog or digital gauges that represent live, or near-live data are examples of IoT Widgets.

Connectors are used to connect forms to other data providers such as QuickBooks, Xero, Microsoft Business Central and many others. Connectors also have actions that allow for workflow that executes on form submission.
